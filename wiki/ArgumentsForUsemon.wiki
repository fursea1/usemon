These are the reasons for why it was necessary to create Usemon

 * Difficult to argument and create a good business case to support buying one of the commercial tools
 * We could not afford to create any compile or build time dependencies to the monitoring system

 * We needed something so light weight that it could be run in our production system 24/7 365 days a year
 * We needed a system that could discover our runtime dependencies
 * * Across Java method invocations and asynchronous JMS Queues
