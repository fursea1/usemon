#summary Build instructions

= Introduction =

Usemon is built using Maven 2. We have several 3rd. party dependencies which must be made available.

= Details =

When compiling for the first time, the following artifacts will appear as unresolved:

  || *Component*  || *Download from*                               ||
  || jcommons   || http://sourceforge.net/projects/jfreechart/ ||
  || jfreechart || http://sourceforge.net/projects/jfreechart/ ||
  || gwt-ext    || http://code.google.com/p/gwt-ext/           ||


== How to install an artifact into your local maven repository ==
 
  # Download the artifact and save the .jar file in a temporary directory
  # Install the artifact into your local repository using this command: 
{{{
mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=jfree -DartifactId=jcommon \
-Dversion=1.0.12 -Dpackaging=jar \
-Dfile=jcommon-1.0.12.jar -DgeneratePom=true 
}}}


= Using Eclipse as development enviroment =

Recommended Eclipse version: 3.3.1.1 (That's what we use, and used as reference when writing the documentation)

== Required plugins ==
 * M2Eclipse: http://m2eclipse.codehaus.org/update/
 * Subclipse: http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.2.x/

== Maven Super POM ==
The Maven super-pom is located in the {{{usemon-pom}}} project. Before the rest of the projects can compile or even be given the Maven nature the {{{usemon-pom}}} project must be installed into the local repository. The quickest way to do this is to comment out the modules section of the {{{usemon-pom/pom.xml}}} file and then choose {{{Run As -> Maven build...}}} and enter "clean install" as goal and then execute. Remember to uncomment the modules in the pom.xml after successfully executing this task.
